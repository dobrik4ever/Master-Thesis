# Abstract
As biology is a quantitative discipline, it requires a lot of evidence to support a hypothesis. Images of cells and tissues are an excellent source of data, but to get meaningful insights, they must be processed, analyzed, and quantified. Deep Neural Networks are one of the techniques used in the data analysis process. These networks may perform remarkably in tasks like picture segmentation and classification, but they need a lot of training data to do so. When images are threedimensional, labeling training data becomes considerably more difficult. To address this issue, a synthetic data simulator is necessary to solve this problem. It can create unlimited annotated data for neural networks to test their performance. This thesis develops a simulation framework, compares its results to actual stacks acquired with a multiphoton microscope, and trains a deep convolutional network using this artificial data to count and classify immune cells.
